      <p className="text-slate-300">
        I am a 2nd‑year Computer Science student at I Square IT, Pune, focused on
        building real‑world software rather than just solving textbook problems.
        Over the past year I have explored AI‑driven platforms, voice assistants,
        and embedded systems.
      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-300">
        Some of my favorite work includes SmartPark, an intelligent parking
        reservation concept for urban tech hubs, Jarvis/Baymax‑style voice
        assistants that automate daily tasks, and hardware experiments with ESP32,
        fingerprint sensors, and displays.
      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-300">
        Alongside projects, I am actively improving my data structures & algorithms,
        competitive programming, and CTF skills to target high‑bar SDE, full‑stack,
        and backend roles. I enjoy taking ideas from scratch to working prototypes
        that people can actually use.
